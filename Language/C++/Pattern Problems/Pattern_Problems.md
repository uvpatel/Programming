# Pattern Problems

**Desclaimer** - Majority it will be not asked in Interview it for understanding about nested loops and build good foundation for concept of Dynamic Programming.

- **Logic For Patterns** - Logic For Pattern - We always write a Generic logic for Pattern Problem n could be anything.


1) Square Pattern

- Easy with number n = 4
```txt
 1 2 3 4
 1 2 3 4
 1 2 3 4
 1 2 3 4
```
e.g for n = 3
```txt
 1 2 3 
 1 2 3 
 1 2 3 
```

**Trick** ->
1. outer loop -> line will decide Outer loop - > n times (0 to n-1 or 0 to n)
2. inner loop -> what work should be done. logic is will written in inner loop -> 1 single row.  -> 
3. After each iteration what happen out output should be printed on the next line after updation of i so we write endl;.
