# Type Casting

- There are basically two type of type casting.
- Converting data from one type to another.
1) Impicit (small to big)
e.g. -> like char => int , float => double.


2) Explicit(big to small)
e.g. -> like int => float.

- when small data type to bigger data type >convertion it is implicit but on bigger data type it is explicitly we have to convert one to another data type.
