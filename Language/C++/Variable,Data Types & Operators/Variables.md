# Variables

- Containers to store data

- variable's are important crux of c++ programming.

- in math we declare x = , and variable are contain values and it is changable. it is container it can store any kind of data grade,name ,number etc.

- in RAM variable take space occupy according to the type. variable is varry it can change.

## Rules:

1. Only letters (A–Z, a–z), digits (0–9), and . underscore (_) are allowed.

2. Cannot start with a digit.

- ❌ 1value → invalid

- ✅ value1 → valid

3. Cannot use keywords/reserved words.

- ❌ int, while, return, etc.

4. No special characters like @, #, $, -, or space.

5. Case-sensitive:

- Value and value are different identifiers.

- Should be meaningful (not a rule but a good practice).

- No length limit in modern compilers, but best to keep it readable.
