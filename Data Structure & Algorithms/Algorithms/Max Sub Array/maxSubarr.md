# Maximum Subarray Sum
- brute force
- Kadane's array

## Sub array
- sub array is a `continuos` part of is called a sub array of original array.

- [1,2,3,4,5]
- [1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]
- [1,2,3],[2,3,4],[3,4,5]
- [1,2,3,4] , [2,3,4,5]
- [1,2,3,4,5]


- **Note** - Total sub array = n*(n+1)/2


- **Logic** - Start , end know

- end = n-1

- like which one is started and ending find.

- finding ending it will be on run a loop from 0 to n-1. we use nested loop.

```c++
for(st)

```
