# Data Structures and Algorithms

>DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) is the study of organizing data efficiently using data structures like arrays, stacks, and trees, paired with step-by-step procedures (or algorithms) to solve problems effectively. Data structures manage how data is stored and accessed, while algorithms focus on processing this data.

## Why to Learn DSA?
- Learning DSA boosts your problem-solving abilities and make you a stronger programmer.

- DSA is foundation for almost every software like GPS, Search Engines, AI ChatBots, Gaming Apps, Databases, Web Applications, etc.

- Top Companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Meta and many other heavily focus on DSA in interviews.

## How to learn DSA?

1. Learn at-least one programming language [C++](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-plus-plus/)
, [JAVA](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/)
 , [Python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-programming-language-tutorial/)
  or [JavaScript](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript/javascript-tutorial/)   and build your basic logic.

2. Learn about [Time and Space complexities](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/time-complexity-and-space-complexity/)

3. Learn Data Structures (Arrays, Linked List, etc) and Algorithms (Searching, Sorting, etc).
4. Once you learn main topics, it is important to solve coding problems against some predefined test cases,
5. Solve problems daily using GfG Problem of the Day
