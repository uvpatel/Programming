# Data Structures and Algorithms

>DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) is the study of organizing data efficiently using data structures like arrays, stacks, and trees, paired with step-by-step procedures (or algorithms) to solve problems effectively. Data structures manage how data is stored and accessed, while algorithms focus on processing this data.

## Why to Learn DSA?
- Learning DSA boosts your problem-solving abilities and make you a stronger programmer.

- DSA is foundation for almost every software like GPS, Search Engines, AI ChatBots, Gaming Apps, Databases, Web Applications, etc.

- Top Companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Meta and many other heavily focus on DSA in interviews.
