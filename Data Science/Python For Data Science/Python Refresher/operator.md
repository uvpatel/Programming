Operators in Python
In this video, we will learn about different types of operators in Python and how they are used in expressions.

1. Arithmetic Operators
Used for basic mathematical operations.

Operator	Description	Example (a=10, b=5)
+	Addition	a + b  # 15
-	Subtraction	a - b  # 5
*	Multiplication	a * b  # 50
/	Division	a / b  # 2.0
//	Floor Division	a // b  # 2
%	Modulus	a % b  # 0
**	Exponentiation	a ** b  # 100000
2. Comparison Operators
Compare values and return True or False.

Operator	Description	Example (a=10, b=5)
==	Equal to	a == b  # False
!=	Not equal to	a != b  # True
>	Greater than	a > b  # True
<	Less than	a < b  # False
>=	Greater or equal	a >= b  # True
<=	Less or equal	a <= b  # False
3. Logical Operators
Used to combine conditional statements.

Operator	Description	Example (x=True, y=False)
and	Both True	x and y  # False
or	Either True	x or y  # True
not	Negation	not x  # False
4. Bitwise Operators
Perform bit-level operations.

Operator	Description	Example (a=5, b=3)
&	AND	a & b  # 1
|	OR	a | b # 7
5. Assignment Operators
Used to assign values to variables.

Operator	Example (a=10)	Equivalent to
=	a = 5	a = 5
+=	a += 5	a = a + 5
-=	a -= 5	a = a - 5
*=	a *= 5	a = a * 5
/=	a /= 5	a = a / 5
//=	a //= 5	a = a // 5
%=	a %= 5	a = a % 5
**=	a **= 5	a = a ** 5
6. Membership & Identity Operators
Check for presence and object identity.

Operator	Description	Example (lst=[1,2,3], x=2)
in	Present in sequence	x in lst  # True
not in	Not present	x not in lst  # False
is	Same object	a is b  # False
is not	Different object	a is not b  # True
