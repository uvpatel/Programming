What is Anaconda | Anaconda vs Miniconda
Miniconda is a lightweight Python distribution with just conda and a few basics, ideal for custom setups. Anaconda is a full package with Python and popular data science libraries pre-installed, great for getting started quickly. Choose Miniconda for flexibility, and Anaconda for convenience.

1. Miniconda:
Lightweight version of Anaconda.

Comes with only conda, pip, and a few essential packages.

When you run conda list after installing Miniconda, packages like NumPy will not be present unless you install it manually using:

conda install numpy

2. Anaconda:
Full distribution with hundreds of packages for data science and machine learning.
Includes NumPy and many other popular libraries (like pandas, matplotlib, etc.).
After installing Anaconda, running conda list will show NumPy by default.

Summary: Miniconda is minimal and does not come with NumPy, while Anaconda is a larger package that includes it.
