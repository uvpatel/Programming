# Jupyterlab and Jupyter notebook Tutorial
Jupyter Notebook vs. JupyterLab
Jupyter is an open-source tool for creating and sharing documents that contain live code, visualizations, equations, and text.

What is Jupyter Notebook?
A simple, interactive environment to write and run code.
Each document (called a notebook) is saved as a .ipynb file.
Useful for quick prototyping, data exploration, and teaching.
A cell in Jupyter Notebook is a container where you can write and run code, markdown, or raw text.
Start Jupyter Notebook by typing:

conda install jupyter

followed by:

jupyter notebook

What is JupyterLab?
JupyterLab is the next-generation interface for Jupyter, offering a more advanced and flexible workspace.

Why We Use JupyterLab:
Multi-Panel Interface: Open notebooks, terminals, text editors, and outputs side by side.
Better Navigation: File browsing and workspace management are easier.
Extensions: Customize with themes and advanced plugins.
Integrated Tools: Combine notebooks with terminals and markdown in one window.
Start JupyterLab:

conda install jupyterlab
jupyter lab

Key Differences:
Feature	Jupyter Notebook	JupyterLab
Interface	Single document view	Multi-tab, multi-panel
Customization	Limited	Extensive via extensions
Performance	Lightweight	Slightly heavier
Use Case	Quick tasks, tutorials	Large projects, workflows
When to Use What:
Jupyter Notebook: Simple analysis, tutorials, and quick checks.
JupyterLab: Complex projects, interactive dashboards, and better organization.
We will use JupyterLab because it provides:

Better Workflow – Manage multiple notebooks and files in one view.
Scalability – Ideal for data science and machine learning projects.
Future-Proofing – JupyterLab is actively developed and might eventually replace Jupyter Notebook (My personal opinion).
As already told you in the video, one of the organizers of the conference I attended in Orlando told me that Jupyter Notebook is a blog where you can execute code. It is an information-rich coding interface. I like this way of looking at it. Hope you are enjoy
