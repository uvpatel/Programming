The Data Science Lifecycle
The Data Science Lifecycle refers to the structured process used to extract insights from data. It involves several stages, from gathering raw data to delivering actionable insights. Here is a breakdown of each step:

1. Problem Definition
Understanding the problem you want to solve.

Identify business objectives and define the question to answer.
Later, we will do a very interesting project called "Coders of Delhi" where we start by understanding the business objective.
Example: "Can we predict customer churn?" or "What factors drive sales?". In "Coders of Delhi" project, the problem is how to find potential friends of a given person in a social network
Key Activities:

Collaborate with stakeholders.
Define success metrics.
Set project goals and deliverables.
2. Data Collection
Gathering relevant data from multiple sources.

Sources may include databases, APIs, web scraping, or third-party datasets. Sometimes if this step is taken care of by another team or it's a data dump given by another team, we don't care where it came from.
Key Activities in data collection:

Identify data sources (structured vs. unstructured).
Collect data using SQL, Python, or automated pipelines.
Ensure data relevance and completeness.
3. Data Cleaning (Data Preprocessing)
Preparing raw data for analysis.

This step addresses missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
Key Activities:

Handle missing or incorrect data.
Standardize formats and remove duplicates.
Manage outliers and inconsistencies.
Fun Fact: Data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning data!

4. Data Exploration (EDA â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis)
Analyzing data patterns and relationships.

Understand data distributions and detect anomalies using visualizations.
Key Activities:

Summarize data using statistics (mean, median, etc.).
Visualize patterns (using Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.).
Identify correlations and outliers. (correlation is how two variables move in relation to each other and outlier is a data point that stands out as unusually different from the rest. Eg. A 190 Kg heavyweight person is an outlier)
5. Model Building
Creating and training machine learning models.

Use algorithms to predict outcomes or classify data.
Key Activities:

Choose appropriate models (e.g., regression, decision trees, neural networks).
Split data into training and testing sets.
Train and fine-tune models.
Common Tools: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch.

6. Model Evaluation
Measuring model performance and accuracy.

Evaluate models using metrics to ensure reliability.
Key Activities:

Use performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, RMSE, ROC curve) to answer questions like - "How often is my model correct?"
Perform cross-validation for robustness. Train using some part of the data and test using some part and average out the accuracy. We will study this in detail later
Compare multiple models for best outcomes.
Key Metrics:

Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.
Regression: RMSE, R-squared.
7. Deployment
Integrating the model into production systems.

Deliver actionable results through APIs or dashboards.
Key Activities:

Package the model for deployment (Usually done using web frameworks like Flask, and FastAPI).
Automate pipelines for continuous learning (MLOps).
Monitor performance post-deployment.
8. Communication & Reporting
Sharing insights with stakeholders. At the end of the day the ML model solves a problem and proper reporting it to the concerned department is very important

Key Activities:

Create dashboards
Present findings clearly and concisely.
Document the process and results.
9. Maintenance & Iteration
Keeping the model accurate and up-to-date.

Key Activities:

Monitor model performance.
Update models with new data.
Refine features and parameters.

Summary
The Data Science Lifecycle is a continuous, iterative process involving:

Problem Definition
Data Collection
Data Cleaning
Data Exploration
Model Building
Model Evaluation
Deployment
Communication & Reporting
Maintenance & Iteration
By following this lifecycle, data scientists transform raw data into meaningful insights that drive better decision-making.
