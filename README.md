# How To Grow as a Programmer?

## Steps: 
1) Pick a Programming Language get the basics.
2) Find it's usecases, which kind of Problem it's solving.
3) Share your work on social and github.
4) Help Others.
5) Do internship and jobs or freelancing and also participate in Hackathon for practical exposure and also get the experience in Real- World Problem Solving. also firstly focus on Fundamental then do things. don't chase intership first. First be Expert in perticular domain.then dive deep. find a niche and do things for upskill your self.
6) Do opensorce as a hobby,Learning VCS (Virsion Control System) is must for every programmer.
7) Build Strong Logic and Fundamentals. Theory Concepts are also important and after getting the theory applying in Development and in Real world application.
8) Utilise your time in productive work, have patience. also , don't stick to one perticular stack or framwork, in programming main thing is problem solving.Use framework and stack according to usecase use them wisely according to project needs.
9) In Programming everything is logical don't just code but logic understanding is always on the top. input output not metter approch always metter in whether it is a life or programming.
10) Know needs and wants in Programming DSA and Development is need so first focus on that and then explore your wants like ML,AI,DS ,DL and blockchain etc.


## Rule of 100:
>" if you want to master any perticular skill. do 100 things releted to that perticular thing releted to skill."

1) Logic Building.
- [Logic Building](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/logic-building-problems/)


2) Learn DSA and Apply in Development.
- [DSA](https://www.example.com)
- [Data Structure](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/)
- [Algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/)


3) Learn About DATA Science and ML and make models. 


4) Deployement.


**Application** : 


- Some thing keep in mind 
1) Do Programming is not that easy. if it is. no lubricative salarys are get for programmers.
2) Programming is a skill and it can be develop according to the time and practice with right approcha and with right roadmap.


**Project & Products** :
1) after learning about programming make projects and also don't clone it entirely. take refrence use your brain.exe and add some kind of fetures which convert entire project into products.
